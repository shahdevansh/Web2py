00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:02,360
Cersei:
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

2
00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:04,262
Varys: <i>Your father has named</i>
<i>Lord Tyrion</i>

3
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:06,264
to serve as Hand
in his stead.

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,867
- You brought this on yourself.
- I've done nothing.

5
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:11,036
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

6
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,338
Does it ever end?

7
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:14,506
Jorah: <i>Everything ends,</i>
<i>even the Red Waste.</i>

8
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:17,008

<i>( Daenerys speaking Dothraki )</i>

9
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,482
Dolorus Edd: <i>All the other wildlings</i>
<i>for 100 leagues</i>

10
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,685
have disappeared.
Craster's still here.

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,955
Any man lays a hand on one
of my wives, he loses the hand.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,523
Dolorus Edd:
<i>He marries his daughters</i>

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,425
<i>and they give him</i>
<i>more daughters.</i>

14
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,960
What happens to the boys?
What does he do with his sons?

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,862
Matthos: <i>"My brother Robert</i>
<i>left no trueborn heirs,</i>

16
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,897
the boy Joffrey
being born of incest

17
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:43,366
between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,867
By right of birth
and blood,

19
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,369
<i>I do this day lay claim to the</i>
<i>Iron Throne of Westeros."</i>

20
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:49,637
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm.

21
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,673
Robb: <i>I'm sending one of</i>
<i>your cousins down to King's</i>

22
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:52,898
<i>Landing with my peace terms.</i>

23
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:55,275
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

24
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,776
You don't know him
very well.

25
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:59,045
We won't beat them until
you take King's Landing.

26
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,281
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

27
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:03,816
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail.

28
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,618
Men who fought
my father.

29
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:08,188
I'm his only living son.
He'll listen to me.

30
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:10,857
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

31
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,560
- I need his ships.
- He is not trustworthy.

32
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:16,363
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime and you.

33
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:18,798
- Father had other children.
- What are you asking?

34
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,467
Joffrey: <i>How many bastards does</i>
<i>he have running around?</i>

35
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:24,170
( Screaming )

36
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:25,471
Where is the bastard?

37
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,840
The Night's Watch!

Man #2:
Okay, keep moving.

Man: <i>Put a watch</i>

Lovely boy.

51
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,387
What do you want?

52
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:03,955
A man has a thirst.

53
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,125
A man does not drink
for a day and a night.

54
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,226
A boy could
make a friend.

55
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,628
- I have friends.
- ( Clangs )

56
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,864
Give us beer
before I skin you.

57
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,967
A man does not choose
his companions.

58
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,902
These two, they have
no courtesy.

59
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:21,271
A man must ask
forgiveness.

60
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,142
You're called Arry?

61
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,515
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar,

62
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,050
once of the free city of--

63
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,719
Beer, you little shit.

64
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,288
Get us beer!

65
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,090
You should have
asked nicely.

66
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,258
Aah!

67
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,500
Come closer
and I'll shove that stick

68
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,203
up your bunghole
and fuck you bloody.

69
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,772
A boy has more courage
than sense.

70
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,374
Come here!

71
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,109
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

72
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:58,211
- Come here!
- They don't scare me.

73
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,313
Hmm?
Then you're stupid.

74
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:02,215
They scare me.

75
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,117
<i>( Horse neighs )</i>

76
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,321
What are Gold Cloaks doing so
far from King's Landing?

77
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,994
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

78
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,930
You in command here?

79
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,900
You're a long way
from home.

80
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,036
I asked you a question.

81
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,838
Aye, you did.

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,942
You asked
without manners

83
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,545
and I chose not to answer.

84
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,615
I have a royal warrant

85
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,286
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

86
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:44,792
Well, the thing is...

87
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,094
These gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch.

88
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,898
<i>Now, that puts them beyond the</i>
<i>reach of Kings and Queens.</i>

89
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,767
Does it?

90
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,169
<i>It's a funny thing--</i>

91
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:57,338
people worry so much
about their throats

92
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,742
that they forget
about what's down low.

93
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:04,980
Now I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

94
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:09,384
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to

95
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,389
or I could nick
this artery in your leg.

96
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,992
And once it's nicked,
there's no one around here

97
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:19,095
who knows
how to unnick it.

98
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,931
We'll just keep that.

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,970
Good steel is always
needed on the Wall.

100
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,704
Seems you have
a choice--

101
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,942
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

102
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,811
or you can go back to your city
and tell your Masters

103
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,847
you didn't find
what you were looking for.

104
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,689
We're looking
for a boy named Gendry.

105
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:50,293
<i>He carries</i>
<i>a bull's head helmet.</i>

106
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:54,331
<i>Anyone turning him over</i>
<i>will earn the King's reward.</i>

107
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,334
We'll be back
with more men

108
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,203
and I'll be taking your head
home along with that bastard boy.

109
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:01,905
<i>( Horse neighs )</i>

110
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,744

111

112
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,656

00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,833
<i>( Shae laughing )</i>

114
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,306
My Lord.

115
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,307
You make me wait
a long time,

116
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,577
but your friend
keeps me company.

117
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,680
We were just speaking
of your bravery

118
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,117
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

119
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:51,554
It was quite a battle.

120
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:55,057
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

121
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:58,027
The northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

122
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,664
And I tell him
the story of how we meet.

123
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,733
To find so lovely
a creature

124
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,569
working in your
father's kitchens--

125
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:07,838
it almost beggars belief.

126
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:10,909
Strange things do happen.

127
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:13,712
You should taste
her fish pie.

128
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:16,081
I don't think Lord Varys
likes fish pie.

129
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,084
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

130
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,320
Tyrion: <i>Men like Lord Varys</i>
<i>and I can't let</i>

131
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:23,522
our disadvantages
get the best of us.

132
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:26,424
We'll make a fisherman
of him yet.

133
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,325
I am glad
your new friend

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,461
was able to accompany you
to the capital.

135
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:35,565
Friends are such
an important part of life.

136
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,067
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

137
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,636
<i>But rest easy, My Lord.</i>

138
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,640
I am very good
at keeping secrets

139
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,875
for my good friends.

140
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:48,378
Your discretion
is legendary...

141
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:49,812
where your friends
are concerned.

142
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:52,315
How unspeakable of me
to go on and on

143
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,584
when all you want
to do is rest.

144
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,753
I will leave you.

145
00:08:58,156 --> 00:08:59,923
Welcome to King's Landing,
my dear.

146
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,394
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

147
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,763
We have a council meeting,
My Lord.

148
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,602
I don't like threats.

149
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,905
- Who threatened you?
- I'm not Ned Stark.

150
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:16,073
I understand the way
this game is played.

151
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,708
Ned Stark
was a man of honor.

152
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,176
And I am not.

153
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:22,713
Threaten me again and I'll have
you thrown into the sea.

154
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,152
You might be disappointed
in the results.

155
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:31,155
Storms come and go,

156
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,357
the big fish eat
the little fish,

157
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,426
and I keep on paddling.

158
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,862
Come, My Lord.

159
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:41,264
We shouldn't keep
the queen waiting.

160
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,304
Cersei: <i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

161
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,172
<i>we are not part</i>
<i>of your realm,</i>

162
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,076
but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North."

163
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:01,281
He has more spirit than
his father, I'll give him that.

164
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:04,618
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

165
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,154
We can give him his father's bones
back at least

166
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,889
as a gesture
of good faith.

167
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,958
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

168
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,061
I will, Your Grace.

169
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,697
Did you see my brother

170
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,132
when you were
the Starks' guest?

171
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,067
Alton:
<i>I did.</i>

172
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,803
<i>They have not broken</i>
<i>his spirit, Your Grace.</i>

173
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:25,540
If you speak with him,

174
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,476
tell him he's not
been forgotten.

175
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,845
- Alton: I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

176
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:37,485
You have a deft hand
with diplomacy.

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,756
- If that's everything...
- A-- a raven flew in this morning

178
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,659
from Castle Black.

179
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,294
Trouble with
the wildlings.

180
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,796
That's why they're
called "wildlings."

181
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,465
Somewhat less wild
these days.

182
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,301
Seems they've stopped
killing each other

183
00:10:53,335 --> 00:10:56,438
and started following
this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

184
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,274
Another king?
How many is that now, five?

185
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,076
( Laughs )
I've lost count.

186
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,913
The Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man the Wall.

187
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,615
Perhaps he's forgotten
we're fighting a war.

188
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,617
We have no men to spare.

189
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,353
"The cold winds
are rising

190
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,956
and the dead rise
with them."

191
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,593
The northerners are
a superstitious people.

192
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,695
According to the Commander,
one of these dead men

193
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,765
attacked him
in his chambers.

194
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,800
Mormont doesn't lie.

195
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:25,470
Varys: <i>How do you kill</i>
<i>a dead man?</i>

196
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:28,439
Apparently you burn him.

197
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,409
One trip to the Wall
and you come back

198
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:34,779
believing in grumpkins
and snarks.

199
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:38,349
I don't know
what I believe,

200
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,450
but here's
a fact for you--

201
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,085
<i>the Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

202
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,787
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

203
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,223
I have every confidence
that the brave men

204
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:49,960
of the Night's Watch
will protect us all.

205
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,163
Dolorous Edd:
<i>And I said,</i>

206
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:54,864
"If the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

207
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,767
they wouldn't make us
fart when we died."

208
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,503
Grenn:
We fart when we die?

209
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:03,472
Dolorous Edd:
My blessed mother--

210
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,574
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

211
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:09,177
She farted so hard,
the whole bed shook.

212
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,283
( Blowing raspberry )

213
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:22,289
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

214
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,792
Wouldn't two or three
be enough for him?

215
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,729
We were having
a serious discussion.

216
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,966
Would you look at that?

217
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:35,205
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

218
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:38,108
I prefer watching them
come towards me.

219
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,743
I'm sure
that's nice, too.

220
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:42,912
Yeah, well, there was
a milkmaid named Violet

221
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,515
on the next farm over
from where I grew up.

222
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,517
<i>We were wrestling together</i>
<i>from the time we were six years old.</i>

223
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:53,522
And then we got older
and the wrestling, uh...

224
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,758
changed.

225
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,626
Sam:
You were with her?

226
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,262
How many times?

227
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,798
Well, as many times
as I could.

228
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,604
I wish I grew up
on a farm.

229
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:10,973
We need more potatoes.

230
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,375
Get another sack
from the sledge.

231
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,881
Get the turnips, too.

232
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,653
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

233
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,322
<i>( Woman screams )</i>

234
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:33,895
No. Ghost, no.

235
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:36,364
<i>No!</i>

236
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,966
Ghost, away.
Shoo, shoo!

237
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:44,872
You all right?

238
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,709
- Did he frighten you?
- You-- you shouldn't touch me.

239
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:51,313
Oh. Oh, right.

240
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:52,982
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,785
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't hurt.

242
00:14:01,827 --> 00:14:03,827
You're very brave.

243
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,172
What are you doing?

244
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,006
This is Gilly.

245
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,442
She's one of Craster's...
daughters.

246
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,325
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?

247
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,018
Sam said
you could help.

248
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,687
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed--

249
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:26,912
She's pregnant.

250
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,228
We have to take her
with us when we leave.

251
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,063
What?

252
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,898
- What would that--
- Sam: I know it sounds a bit mad.

253
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,666
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

254
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:45,035
- The Lord Commander ordered us to--
- We are sworn to protect.

255
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:47,637
- Sam, we can't take--
- Please, Ser, please.

256
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,572
I can still run
if I have to.

257
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,008
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

258
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,610
If it's a boy...

259
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,578
If it's a boy, what?

260
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,952
You want us to risk
our lives for you

261
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,088
and you won't even
tell us why?

262
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,730
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

263
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,565
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

264
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,567
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

265
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,936
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

266
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,705
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

267
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,740
I can't steal her.

268
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,042
She's a person,
not a goat.

269
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:35,418
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

270
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:38,255
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

271
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:41,191
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

272
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,093
Who's going to
deliver a baby, you?

273
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,297
I could try.

274
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:49,266
What?
I've read about it.

275
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,902
A bit.

276
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:55,707
I'm sorry, Sam.

277
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,642
We can't help her.

278
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,721
( Sighs )

279
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:17,495

- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

286
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,026
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

287
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,395
<i>Khal Jhaqo.</i>

288
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,498
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a Khalasar.

289
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,767
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

290
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:08,343

It looks smaller.

297

Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

298

I remember
my father's cabin

felt like a palace

Now look at it.
( Giggles )

301

They'll be waiting
for me on the docks.

This is a big day for them.

They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

<i>Always has been.</i>

Oh, I love
the cold and wet.

Better.

00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,348
My father doesn't trust
you Iron islanders.

316
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,350
I don't blame him.

317
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:33,387
<i>He says that you're all</i>
<i>reavers and rapers</i>

318
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,255
and that no matter
how many women you have,

319
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:37,290
- you'll never be sat-- uh!
- ( Grunts )

320
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:40,593
- Quit talking about your father.
- ( Moans )

321
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:43,430
But he's right
about us.

322
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:47,166
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

323
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,569
That's not enough for us.

324
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:52,071
That's why
we take salt wives--

325
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:53,673
the women we capture.

326
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,208
Capture me.

327
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:57,343
Take me with you
when you go ashore.

328
00:20:57,378 --> 00:21:01,515
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

329
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,683
Not after you leave.

330
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:06,052
Father will punish me.

331
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:07,687
He'll call me a whore.

332
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:11,258
I haven't paid you.

333
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,532
( Both grunting )

334
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,840
( Moaning )
Oh, yeah.

335
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,649
( Jewelry jangling )

336
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,017
<i>( Door opens )</i>

337
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:37,986
- Man: <i>I paid good money...</i>
- <i>( Door slams )</i>

338
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:45,727
<i>( Man grumbling )</i>

339
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,831
- I'm not going to stand for this.
- <i>( Woman crying )</i>

340
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,566
I barely touched her.

341
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,802
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

342
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,703
and this is
what I get-- crying.

343
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:58,073
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

344
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,575
( Snaps fingers )

345
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:09,785
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

346
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,187
Aremca will take
good care of you.

347
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,129
<i>( Crying continues )</i>

348
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:46,722
- I'm sorry, My Lord.
- Shh, shh.

349
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,792
Did he hurt you?

350
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,930
No, My Lord.

351
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:56,733
( Sniffles )
It's Mhaegen.

352
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:59,135
Who?

353
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,873
She works for you.

354
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:06,510
She's the one--
the Gold Cloaks,

355
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:08,845
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

356
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,548
That was...

357
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:13,784
poorly handled.

358
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,455
Sometimes those
with the most power

359
00:23:17,489 --> 00:23:20,191
have the least grace.

360
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:23,795
I can't stop
thinking about it.

361
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:25,931
I can't sleep.

362
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:30,435
That poor little baby.

363
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,271
You know, you remind me
of another girl,

364
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:35,340
a lovely thing
I once acquired

365
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,376
from a Lysene
pleasure house--

366
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:41,546
beautiful, like yourself,

367
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,116
and intelligent,
like yourself.

368
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:48,019
But she wasn't happy.

369
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:52,424
She cried often.

370
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:56,561
I asked her why,
but we didn't have

371
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:59,465
the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

372
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,404
Yes, it was quite sad.

373
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:10,410
Girls from the Lysene
pleasure houses are expensive,

374
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:12,579
extremely expensive.

375
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:16,250
And this one wasn't
making me any money.

376
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:23,023
I hate bad investments.

377
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:26,092
Really, I-- I do.

378
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,161
They haunt me.

379
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,268
I had no idea
how to make her happy,

380
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,370
no idea how
to mitigate my losses.

381
00:24:39,739 --> 00:24:42,007
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me

382
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,642
a tremendous
amount of money

383
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:48,647
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

384
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:52,451
To use her
in ways that...

385
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:55,221
would never occur
to most men.

386
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,625
And you know what
occurs to most men.

387
00:25:02,863 --> 00:25:07,700
I would not say he succeeded in
making her happy,

388
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:12,338
but my losses were
definitely mitigated.

389
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:22,281
Take tonight off
to mourn Mhaegen's child.

390
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,751
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

391
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:28,554
And you'll be happy?

392
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,060
That makes me happy.

393
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:44,169
- <i>( Distant hoofbeats )</i>
- <i>( People chattering )</i>

394
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:45,838
( Crying )

395
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:47,506
Tyrion:
<i>More wine?</i>

396
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,542
- Janos: Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, My Lord.

397
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:54,613
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
know how to pour our own wine.

398
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,183
That's your new squire?

399
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:59,251
I could've found you
a proper lad.

400
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:02,021
Myself, I prefer
the improper ones.

401
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:05,058
Mm, that's a good red.
Dornish?

402
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:06,559
You know your wines,
My Lord.

403
00:26:06,593 --> 00:26:08,094
That I do.

404
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,931
( Sighs )
A fine dinner, My Lord.

405
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,900
Call me Tyrion, please.

406
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,769
I'm sure you're getting
used to fine dinners,

407
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:16,337
now that you're a lord.

408
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:18,239
Maybe I'll hire
this cook of yours.

409
00:26:18,274 --> 00:26:20,275
Wars have been
started for less.

410
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:22,277
( Both laugh )

411
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:25,447
I heard there was some trouble in
Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

412
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:27,615
Mm, nasty business.

413
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,617
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

414
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,885
The City Watch
must keep the peace,

415
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,788
only I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

416
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:39,358
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

417
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,460
Especially
the queen's orders.

418
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:43,262
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

419
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:47,800
No, but who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

420
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,468
She's always been
a jealous woman.

421
00:26:49,502 --> 00:26:51,503
You know your sister
better than I do.

422
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:53,572
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

423
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,241
I don't listen to filth.

424
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:58,544
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

425
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:01,480
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

426
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:04,182
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

427
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,285
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

428
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,487
I appreciate
your loyalty.

429
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:14,091
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

430
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:17,961
in the throne room,
did you give the order?

431
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,963
I did.

432
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:21,698
And I would again.

433
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:23,533
The man was a traitor.

434
00:27:23,568 --> 00:27:25,536
He tried to buy
my loyalty.

435
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,738
The fool.

436
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,907
He had no idea
you were already bought.

437
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:32,143
Are you drunk?

438
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,346
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp!

439
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:38,484
I'm not questioning
Your Honor, Lord Janos.

440
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,187
I'm denying its existence.

441
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:43,323
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf--

442
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,092
Dwarf? Mm, you should
have stopped at Imp.

443
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:48,795
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

444
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,198
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

445
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,234
I intend to serve
as Hand of the King

446
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,935
until my father
returns from the war.

447
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,070
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

448
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:01,006
well, I just wouldn't
feel safe with you lurking about.

449
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,541
What are you t--

450
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:04,344
My friends at court
will not allow this!

451
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,479
- The queen herself has granted--
- The <i>queen regent.</i>

452
00:28:06,513 --> 00:28:09,382
And you're a fool to believe
she is your friend.

453
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,752
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

454
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:14,855
- No, we shan't.
- <i>( Footsteps approach )</i>

455
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,392
<i>( Doors open )</i>

456
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:23,698
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

457
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:27,367
From there I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

458
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,537
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

459
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:32,439
I found it
surprisingly beautiful...

460
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:36,410
in a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

461
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:37,978
The lads will escort you.

462
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:39,880
The streets aren't safe
at night, My Lord.

463
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:42,283
These men are
under my command!

464
00:28:42,317 --> 00:28:44,485
I command you to arrest
this cutthroat.

465
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,354
His name is Bronn

466
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:48,689
and he is the new
commander of the City Watch.

467
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:50,357
Boys.

468
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,895
( Janos grunting )
I have friends at court,

469
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,465
powerful friends!

470
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,067
The king himself
made me a lord!

471
00:29:05,007 --> 00:29:07,275
To the new Commander.

472

Without question? No.

476

So, if they've got armor on,
it's a battle.

No, it isn't.

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,482
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

Gendry's an armorer's

Gendry:

498
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:34,362
A knight.

499

How'd you know
he was a knight?

500
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:41,703
Well, it was 'cause
he got armor on.

501
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:43,771
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor.

Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

Lord Stark?

520

See? Asking me
questions is bad luck.

521

You'll probably
be dead soon.

- What did they ask about?
- My mom.

- Who's your mom?
- Just my mom--

And who was your father?

526

Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

What about you anyway?

528
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:07,551
You thought
they were after you.

529
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,386
Why?

530
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:11,955
Did you kill someone or is it
just because you're a girl?

531
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:15,258
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

Yeah? Well, pull your cock out

00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,356
like a trained raven
clutching his message.

630
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:14,358
The offer he makes
is one I proposed.

631
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,961
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

632
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:18,563
hunted with him,
fought at his side.

633
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,232
He thinks of me
as a brother.

634
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:22,902
No, not here,
not in my hearing.

635
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,437
You will not
name him brother,

636
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:29,408
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

637
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:32,278
Or have you forgotten
your own blood?

638
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:34,280
I forget nothing.

639
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,183
I remember my brothers.

640
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:40,153
And I remember
when my father was a king.

641
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:58,239
I see.

642
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:00,875
I destroy Robb Stark's
enemies for him

643
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:04,312
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

644
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:08,148
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

645
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:10,784
I'm your son,
your only living heir.

646
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:13,253
- Who else?
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

647
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:17,390
I told you to wait outside.

648
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,827
How did you get
past the guards?

649
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,262
Anything with a cock
is easy to fool.

650
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:26,066
My dear.

651
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,837
Yara?

652
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:33,740
So good to see you,
brother.

653
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:37,410
This is a homecoming I'll tell
my grandchildren about.

654
00:39:39,914 --> 00:39:41,348
She can't lead an attack!

655
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:44,618
- Balon: And why not?
- You're a woman!

656
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:48,088
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

657
00:39:48,123 --> 00:39:50,624
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

658
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:53,527
after your new father
killed him.

659
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:57,264
All:
What's dead may never die.

660
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:59,300
The only nights she's spent
off these islands

661
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:01,335
have been spent
on the sea.

662
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,371
<i>She's commanded men.</i>

663
00:40:04,405 --> 00:40:06,440
<i>She's killed men.</i>

664
00:40:06,474 --> 00:40:08,609
She knows who she is.

665
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:13,714
No man gives me
a crown.

666
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:16,951
I pay the iron price.

667
00:40:16,985 --> 00:40:18,919
I will take my crown,

668
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:22,223
for that is who I am.

669
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,692
That is who
we have always been.

670
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,400
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

671
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:34,303
Who said anything
about the Lannisters?

672
00:40:41,913 --> 00:40:43,381
Davos:
<i>You'll have your gold</i>

673
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,049
<i>when we take the treasury</i>
<i>at King's Landing.</i>

674
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,851
Salladhor: All these kings
fighting for the throne,

675
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,821
and this Stannis
has the smallest army.

676
00:40:49,855 --> 00:40:51,822
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

677
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:55,159
Because you're
a smart gambler.

678
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:58,162
Stannis has proved
himself in war twice.

679
00:40:58,196 --> 00:41:01,465
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

680
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,267
Neither has
the false King Joffrey.

681
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:05,269
And yet they both
have larger armies.

682
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:07,271
Stannis has just
begun the fight.

683
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:10,907
His bannermen
will rally to his cause.

684
00:41:10,942 --> 00:41:13,643
There's no man
in the Seven Kingdoms

685
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:15,245
more honorable
than Stannis Baratheon

686
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:16,679
or more worthy
of loyalty.

687
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:18,280
What is the world
coming to

688
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:20,916
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

689
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,352
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

690
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:24,920
You think I'm insulted?

691
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:27,956
I <i>am</i> a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

692
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:30,626
<i>I don't sail</i>
<i>for promises.</i>

693
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,060
Of course you do.

694
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:34,763
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise--

695
00:41:34,797 --> 00:41:36,264
a promise that
somewhere on the sea,

696
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:38,700
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

697
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:41,503
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

698
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:43,773
You're not a young man,
Salladhor.

699
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,608
And correct me
if I'm wrong--

700
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,343
most pirates
don't grow old.

701
00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:49,479
Only the clever ones.

702
00:41:49,513 --> 00:41:52,415
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

703
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:54,550
stealing from
Pentoshi cheesemongers

704
00:41:54,585 --> 00:41:55,919
and Meereenese
silk merchants?

705
00:41:55,953 --> 00:41:58,020
Then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

706
00:41:58,055 --> 00:41:59,756
That's easy.

707
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,325
What I'm offering you
is hard.

708
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:07,897
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

709
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:10,633
You'll be the richest man
in Lys and the most famous.

710
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:14,537
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

711
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:18,474
"Salladhor Saan"
is a good name for songs.

712
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:22,077
- It is.
- <i>One thing-- I want the queen.</i>

713
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:24,913
- The queen?
- Cersei-- I want her.

714
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:27,415
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

715
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,751
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

716
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:33,054
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

717
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,923
This war
isn't about you.

718
00:42:34,957 --> 00:42:38,259
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

719
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:41,095
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

720
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,264
As if she would
just let you.

721
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:44,965
You don't know
how persuasive I am.

722
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,267
I've never tried
to fuck you.

723
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,606
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

724
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,007
- the one true God--
- ( Groans )

725
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,608
I've been all over
the world, my boy,

726
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:58,311
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true Gods.

727
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,513
They all think
they found the right one.

728
00:43:00,547 --> 00:43:03,850
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

729
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:06,453
and better yet,
a queen's legs.

730
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:10,057
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

731
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:11,792
Eh, he's young yet.

732
00:43:13,095 --> 00:43:15,830
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

733
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:17,599
I cannot promise you
the queen.

734
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:22,804
You believe
your king can win?

735
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:25,039
He is the one true king.

736
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:26,874
You Westerosi
are funny people.

737
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:29,276
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

738
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:32,046
( Laughs )

739
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,648
I'll sail with you,
Davos Seaworth.

740
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:38,285
You're the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

741
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,520
Make me rich.

742
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:43,957
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

743
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,405
Matthos: <i>When will the king</i>
<i>have us sail?</i>

744
00:43:57,439 --> 00:43:59,774
As soon as his God
wills it.

745
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:02,444
He's my God, too,
and yours,

746
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,147
but you are
too blind to see.

747
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,284
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

748
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:10,985
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

749
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,220
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

750
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,022
I wish I had
a God, truly.

751
00:44:15,057 --> 00:44:17,725
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
men pray to every God there is--

752
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:20,160
pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home.

753
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:22,963
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

754
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:26,934
- I wasn't praying.
- No, but I was.

755
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:30,070
Every night
that you were at sea,

756
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:33,207
I lit a candle
and I prayed for you.

757
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:35,942
You want me
to have a God?

758
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:39,112
Fine. King Stannis
is my God.

759
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:41,614
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

760
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:44,217
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

761
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:46,253
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

762
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:49,556
You think a Fire God
commanded all that?

763
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,992
It was Stannis,
only Stannis.

764
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:55,895
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

765
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,897
Don't tell him that.
( Laughs )

766
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:02,868
Cersei: Lord Janos Slynt was
commander of the City Watch.

767
00:45:02,902 --> 00:45:04,303
You had no right
to exile him.

768
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,038
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

769
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,607
You're serving as the King's Hand
till father gets here.

770
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:10,209
I am Queen Regent.

771
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:11,911
Listen to me,
Queen Regent.

772
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:14,347
You're losing the people.

773
00:45:14,382 --> 00:45:16,484
- Do you hear me?
- ( Laughs ) The people.

774
00:45:16,518 --> 00:45:18,286
You think I care?

775
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,988
You might
find it difficult

776
00:45:20,022 --> 00:45:22,891
to rule over millions
who want you dead.

777
00:45:22,925 --> 00:45:24,792
Half the city will starve
when winter comes.

778
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:26,361
The other half will plot
to overthrow you.

779
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:29,397
<i>And your gold-plated thugs</i>
<i>just gave them</i>

780
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:31,233
their rallying cry--

781
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:33,869
"The Queen
slaughters babies."

782
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,441
You don't even have
the decency to deny it.

783
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:52,521
It wasn't you who gave
the order, was it?

784
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:54,423
<i>Joffrey didn't</i>
<i>even tell you.</i>

785
00:45:57,161 --> 00:45:58,795
Did he tell you?

786
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,164
I imagine that
would be even worse.

787
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,134
He did what needed
to be done.

788
00:46:03,168 --> 00:46:06,204
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

789
00:46:06,238 --> 00:46:09,106
This is what ruling is--
lying on a bed of weeds,

790
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,575
ripping them out
by the root, one by one,

791
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,176
before they strangle you
in your sleep.

792
00:46:13,211 --> 00:46:15,745
I'm no king, but I think there's more
to ruling than that.

793
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:17,780
I don't care
what you think!

794
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:19,382
You've never
taken it seriously.

795
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,750
You haven't,
Jaime hasn't.

796
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:27,289
It's all fallen on me.

797
00:46:31,295 --> 00:46:35,131
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

798
00:46:40,037 --> 00:46:42,472
You're funny.

799
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:48,345
You've always
been funny...

800
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:50,314
<i>But none of your jokes</i>
<i>will ever match</i>

801
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:52,549
the first one, will they?

802
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,453
You remember?

803
00:46:56,488 --> 00:46:58,189
Back when you ripped
my mother open

804
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,924
on your way out of her
and she bled to death?

805
00:47:02,427 --> 00:47:05,095
She was my mother, too.

806
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:07,197
Mother gone...

807
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,101
for the sake of you.

808
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:17,107
<i>There's no bigger joke</i>
<i>in the world than that.</i>

809
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,661
<i>( Waves crashing,</i>
<i>seagulls screeching )</i>

810
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,396
<i>( Door opens )</i>

811
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,466
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

812
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,634
Stannis: How did you fare
with your pirate?

813
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:47,105
Salladhor Saan will join
our fleet-- 30 ships.

814
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:49,140
His men know
how to fight.

815
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:52,577
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

816
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:54,246
It does seem
the wiser choice.

817
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,715
There won't be
a choice this time.

818
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,652
Do you trust him?

819
00:47:59,686 --> 00:48:01,387
Salladhor Saan
is an old friend.

820
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,389
I've known him 30 years.

821
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,691
I've never trusted him,

822
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:09,829
but once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

823
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:13,099
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

824
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,871
Leave us.

825
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:25,613
At once, Your Grace.

826
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:35,823
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

827
00:48:35,857 --> 00:48:38,793
( Whispering )

828
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:43,130
Come.

829
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:48,902
<i>( Doors close )</i>

830
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,471
What did you say to him?

831
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:54,941
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

832
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:58,178
- Why?
- <i>Because it is true.</i>

833
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,980
You're troubled, my king.

834
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:03,182
Yeah.

835
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,852
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

836
00:49:05,886 --> 00:49:08,855
Tell your lord
to burn them, then.

837
00:49:08,889 --> 00:49:10,323
I tell him nothing.

838
00:49:10,357 --> 00:49:13,560
I pray for his commands
and I obey.

839
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:19,232
My little brother has 100,000
men according to the scouts,

840
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:22,469
men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

841
00:49:22,503 --> 00:49:24,404
<i>You must have faith.</i>

842
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:26,473
Faith?

843
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:30,043
<i>In a real war, the side</i>
<i>with the greater number wins</i>

844
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:32,012
nine times out of 10.

845
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,680
Then we must be
the 10th.

846
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:38,052
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

847
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:41,556
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

848
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:46,728
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

849
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:51,599
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

850
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:54,969
I've said the words,
damn you.

851
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:00,341
I burnt the idols.

852
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:07,615
You must give
all of yourself.

853
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,121
I have a wife.

854
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:17,325
I took a vow.

855
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:22,863
She's sickly, weak...

856
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:27,501
Shut away in a tower.

857
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,637
She disgusts you.

858
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:35,676
And she's given
you nothing--

859
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:40,448
no sons,
only stillborns,

860
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:42,650
only death.

861
00:50:48,623 --> 00:50:53,093
I will give you
a son, my king.

862
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,531
